Databases are systems that store and organize data in a structured way, allowing users to query, manipulate, and analyze the data efficiently. Database design is the process of defining the structure, relationships, and constraints of the data in a database. The learning objectives of an introductory course for database design and concept are: To understand the concepts and principles that underlie how databases work, such as data models, schemas, keys, normalization, and transactions. To learn the different types of databases and database management systems, such as relational, hierarchical, network, object-oriented, and NoSQL databases. To acquire the skills to use a database language, such as SQL (Structured Query Language), to create, read, update, and delete data in a database. To apply the knowledge and skills to design and implement a simple database system for a given problem or scenario. To explore the current trends and challenges in database technology, such as big data, data warehousing, data mining, and cloud computing.
