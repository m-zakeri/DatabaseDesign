# Tutorials
## Create development environment
First install docker. Then run `docker compose up` command to start development server. There are ports you can test the website:
- http://localhost:8000 is for backend and api
- http://localhost:3000 is for frontend
- http://localhost:8080 is main website over nginx webserver

## How to use fake_data generator
After you do the start up for development server do fallowing step:

1. Command `docker container ls`. Find the container id for academic_staff_management_system-backend, suppose it is b3a4f9b1d432, we just use the first 4 letters .ie b3a4

2. Command `docker exec -it b3a4 bash` to enter the docker space for backend container.

3. Command `./manage.py shell < fake_data.py` to start fake data generation script. Please make sure you are connected to the internet
